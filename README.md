What is art? Let's find out

#Scrapers
Found two potential scrapers. Both use the wiki art database. 
1. This one works: wiki art one https://github.com/lucasdavid/wikiart
2. This one should but doesn't  https://github.com/robbiebarrat/art-DCGAN/blob/master/genre-scraper.py
3. Alternatively we could use this kaggle dataset [83 gigs] https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers/data


Either way it is very clear that uhh.... this is a lot of art.
